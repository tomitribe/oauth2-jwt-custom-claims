# OAuth 2.0 with JWT and Custom Claims

This web application aims at showing how to use the Tribestream API Gateway to authenticate users.
In this example we'll be showing how to add custom business data inside the JWT.

## Requirements

This project is self contained or depends on external libraries available on public repositories.
It also uses the Tribestream API Gateway docker image.

In your laptop, you will need a Java 8 JDK installed.
You also need Docker and Maven installed.

## Build the project

You will need to checkout the source locally and then build the project.
Here are the steps

```
git clone TODO
cd gateway-custom-claims
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

## Starting the Tribestream API Gateway

In order to work, this application requires an STS (Secure Token Service) capable of generating signed JWT tokens.
This is what the Tribestream API Gateway is about.
It's also capable of doing routing and while enforcing permissions.
If you want to know more, check out the website at https://tribestream.io

The best and simplest way to start the API Gateway is to use Docker as follow

```
docker run --rm -it --name tag -e LICENSE=accept -e CASSANDRA_EMBEDDED=true -p 8080:8080 tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway:latest
```

Once the Tribestream API Gateway is up and running, you can connect to the console with the following URL
http://localhost:8080/tag/

## Populating and configuring the Tribestream API Gateway

To ease configuration, this project comes with necessary configuration and scripts to load the configuration of the API Gateway.
You can also navigate through the UI and do it your self.

But as a faster solution, run the following commands

```
cd src/main/scripts
chmod +x *.sh
./load-configuration.sh
```

NOTE: you need to make sure you first started the API Gateway with the previous step.

## Starting the movie chat application

Next step consists in starting the demo application.
From the project root directory, run the following command.

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests tomee:run
```

It should start on port 8181 so it does not clash with the Gateway
So what you need is to open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8181/moviefun/

There are 4 accounts created with the import scripts (See step 2).
- alex/password with create, update and delete role
- john/password with create role
- nick/password with delete role
- mark/password with update role

As soon as you get in the application using one of these accounts, checkout the HTTP requests from the application to the remote server.
If you are using the Chrome browser, you can open up the developer tools.

You should be able to see an authorization header with the JWT obtained from the API Gateway.
Once you have it, go to http://jwt.io to decode the JWT and see the content.
There should be a claim named `aud` and containing `[\"microprofile\",\"jwt\",\"tomee\"]`.

This is a custom claim configured in the API Gateway and using an endpoint from the application.
The source code of the endpoint is available under `src/main/java/org/superbiz/moviefun/sts/MovieClaimsSourceResource`.

If now you want to return actual business data, change the code to return something else and restart the tomee server (see command above).
When done, logout and login again in the application and decode the new JWT.
You should see the updated `aud` claim.

## Testing your claim source from the UI

Go to the following page http://localhost:8080/tag/claim-source/movies-claims-source
You will see the configuration for the claim source.
It is using an API Connection.
Click the link if you want to see the definition of the API Connection.

When you are on the API Claim Source definition, click the 3 dots at the top right of the page.
There is a link `Test`

The dialog opens and allows you to simulate an OAuth2 grant.
Select `password` for the grant type input and enter a valid username (see above for the list).
Finally, click `TEST`.

Bellow, you should all the details and the returned data for the specified user.
This is particularly useful if you want to change the resource endpoint and see the result.
